  <h2 class="center">Defferentiating Narrativistics From Pataphysics</h2>
  <p class="text">
Narrativistics and pataphysics are similar fields of study. To explain the difference between narrativistics and pataphysics 
we (obviously) have to define what they study.<br>
Narrativisitics has a top down view and pataphysics has an inside up view. For narrativistics, this means
that it looks at the whole system from the outside; while in pataphysics it looks at a system from the inside.<br>
In narrativistics, it studies all narratives and narrative framework as a whole. As for pataphysics, it is more about the authors.    
  </p>
  <h2 class="center">How Are Narratives Organized?</h2>
  <p class="text">
You can imagine narratives to be "lined up next to each other", like how lanes on a highway are arranged side by side. Except there are infinite lanes and
they aren't lined up. A narrative can always be found between two other narratives. Remember that this is only an 
explanation that we use to not confuse our feable human minds.   
  </p>
  <h3 class="center">Authors</h3>
  <p class="text">
Authors are the beings responsible for the creation of narratives. They exist at an infinitly higher narritive 
layer than the narritive that is being experienced by the audiance. If an author is being referenced in the narrative
it is writing then a new narrative layer is created with that author inside of it. The original author is marked as
<span class="tele">author<sup>+2</sup></span> and the new author as <span class="tele">author<sup>+1</sup></span>.
You can imagine it like this:<br>
    <div class="center">
     <ol><span class="tele">Author<sup>+2</sup></span> writes <span class="tele">author<sup>+1</sup></span> into the narrative.</ol>
     <ol><span class="tele">Author<sup>+1</sup></span> then interacts with the characters in the narrative.</ol>
